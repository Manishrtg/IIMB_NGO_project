        <h2>About Our Mission</h2>
        <p>At "Support Education," we are committed to empowering the next generation of leaders by ensuring that every child, regardless of location or economic background, has access to quality education. We are currently focusing on schools in the Karnataka district, where we identify areas that lack proper infrastructure, technology, and teacher support.</p>

        <p>Our mission is not just about providing material resources, but about creating a sustainable change by fostering a culture of education where all schools are equipped to offer quality education to every child. With your support, we are making a lasting impact.</p>

        <h2>Our Current Projects</h2>
        <p>We have identified key areas where schools are in dire need of support. Our approach is data-driven and research-based, ensuring that each project is tailored to meet the specific needs of the schools. Here are some of the major ongoing projects:</p>

                <h3>Infrastructure Development</h3>
                <p>Many schools in rural areas lack proper infrastructure. Some classrooms are overcrowded, while others lack basic facilities such as toilets, electricity, or drinking water. Our goal is to provide funding for the construction of additional classrooms, sanitation facilities, and playgrounds that foster a healthy and safe learning environment for students.</p>

                <h3>Technology in Education</h3>
                <p>In today’s digital world, technology plays a crucial role in shaping education. However, many schools still lack computers, projectors, or internet connectivity. Our initiative aims to equip schools with the necessary tools, including smart boards, tablets, and computers, while also providing teachers with training on how to integrate technology into their teaching methods effectively.</p>

                <h3>Teacher Training Programs</h3>
                <p>Teachers are at the heart of any educational system. Unfortunately, many teachers in underfunded schools have limited access to professional development. Through our teacher training programs, we provide workshops and certifications in modern teaching techniques, child psychology, and classroom management, ensuring that teachers are equipped to handle diverse classroom settings and needs.</p>
